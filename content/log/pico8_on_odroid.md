## buy pico 8
go to [itch.io](https://lexaloffle.itch.io/pico-8) and download the raspi version.
pico-8 was in the blm bundle that everyone has, you probably already own it.

## put it in your roms folder
now extract the contents of the folder called `pico-8` into the `pico-8` roms folder on your sd card.

not the bios folder...
i struggled with this...

## it works now, congratulations
play the games. you love the games.
